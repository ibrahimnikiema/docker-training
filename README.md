# Mutual Docker Beginner Training Lab

This is a sample groovy application used for the beginner session.

To use this project, you can download a copy as a zip file or create a fork and set the origin to your new repository.
When creating a fork, be sure to uncheck the "sync branches" option when prompted.

    - Copy/Add build artifact to the container
    - Create default command fo the container
    
## Lab 3: Troubleshooting
    - Run the container locally
    - Inspect running container
